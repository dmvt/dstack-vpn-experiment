# VPN Deployment Recovery Plan - Interrupted Deployment

**Date:** 2025-01-06 20:45  
**Issue:** Deployment script interrupted during Phala CVM setup  
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress - Partial deployment completed

## Current Deployment State

### ✅ Completed Successfully
1. **WireGuard Key Generation** - All keys and configs generated
2. **DigitalOcean Hub** - Created and configured at 206.189.207.149
3. **Hub WireGuard Setup** - WireGuard service running on hub
4. **Configuration Files** - All WireGuard configs generated in `config/` directory

### 🔄 In Progress
1. **Phala CVM Creation** - `dstack-vpn-node-1` created but still starting
2. **Node WireGuard Deployment** - Not yet started
3. **Status Service Deployment** - Not yet started

### ❌ Not Started
1. **Additional Phala nodes** (need 3 total)
2. **VPN connectivity testing**
3. **Status service verification**

## Current Infrastructure Status

### DigitalOcean Hub
- **Status**: ✅ Active and running
- **IP**: 206.189.207.149
- **WireGuard**: ✅ Configured and running
- **SSH Access**: ✅ Working

### Phala CVM
- **Name**: dstack-vpn-node-1
- **Status**: 🔄 Starting (taking longer than expected)
- **App ID**: app_b894bc9096a3da5badae207ac1b059e9b7fbbbbe
- **Hostname**: 120726459afe0c002ceee82010b98e329c1c276b-8090.dstack-prod7.phala.network
- **SSH Access**: ❌ Not yet accessible

## Issues Identified

### 1. CVM Startup Time
- **Problem**: CVM taking >5 minutes to start (normal is 2-3 minutes)
- **Possible Causes**: 
  - Resource constraints on Phala node
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Image initialization problems

### 2. Deployment Script Interruption
- **Problem**: Script was interrupted during CVM setup
- **Impact**: Incomplete deployment state
- **Recovery**: Need to manually continue or restart

### 3. Missing Nodes
- **Problem**: Only 1 CVM created, need 3 total
- **Cause**: Script interrupted before creating additional nodes

## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Wait and Continue (Recommended)
1. Wait for current CVM to fully start
2. Manually continue deployment from current state
3. Create remaining 2 CVMs
4. Complete WireGuard configuration

### Option 2: Clean Restart
1. Destroy current CVM
2. Run deployment script again from beginning
3. Ensure no interruptions during execution

### Option 3: Manual Deployment
1. Use existing hub and configs
2. Manually create and configure remaining CVMs
3. Deploy WireGuard and status services manually

## Recommended Recovery Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Monitor CVM Status**: Continue checking if CVM becomes accessible
2. **Verify Hub Status**: Ensure hub is still working properly
3. **Check Phala Node Availability**: Verify sufficient nodes available

### If CVM Becomes Accessible
1. **Complete Node 1 Setup**: Deploy WireGuard and status service
2. **Create Additional CVMs**: Deploy nodes 2 and 3
3. **Test Connectivity**: Verify VPN between hub and nodes

### If CVM Fails
1. **Destroy Failed CVM**: Clean up and start fresh
2. **Investigate Failure**: Check Phala logs and node status
3. **Restart Deployment**: Run script again with monitoring

## Technical Details

### Generated Configuration Files
- `config/hub/wg0.conf` - Hub configuration with peer entries
- `config/nodes/node1.conf` - Node 1 configuration
- `config/nodes/node2.conf` - Node 2 configuration  
- `config/nodes/node3.conf` - Node 3 configuration

### WireGuard Network
- **Network**: 10.88.0.0/24
- **Hub IP**: 10.88.0.1
- **Node IPs**: 10.88.0.11, 10.88.0.12, 10.88.0.13

### Required Environment Variables
- `HUB_PUBLIC_IP`: 206.189.207.149
- `HUB_PUBLIC_KEY`: Generated and available
- `WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY_A/B/C`: Generated and available

## Next Steps

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for CVM to fully start
2. **Test SSH connectivity** to CVM
3. **If accessible**: Continue manual deployment
4. **If not accessible**: Investigate and consider restart
5. **Document any new issues** in tool reports

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Hub is stable and working
- **Medium Risk**: CVM startup issues may indicate underlying problems
- **High Risk**: If CVM never becomes accessible, may need complete restart

## Success Criteria

- All 3 Phala CVMs running and accessible
- WireGuard VPN connectivity between hub and nodes
- Status services responding on all nodes
- End-to-end VPN functionality working
