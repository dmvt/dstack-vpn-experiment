# VPN Deployment Final Status Report

**Date:** 2025-01-06 21:15  
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Partial Success - Hub Working, Node Issues  
**Deployment Method:** Fixed deployment script with temporary Docker Compose files

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. âœ… Fixed Deployment Script Issues
- **Problem**: Script was prompting for Docker Compose file and environment variables
- **Solution**: Created temporary Docker Compose files with hardcoded values for each node
- **Result**: Script now deploys without hanging on prompts

### 2. âœ… Fixed CVM Status Detection
- **Problem**: Script couldn't parse Phala CLI output correctly
- **Solution**: Updated parsing to handle table format with proper field extraction
- **Result**: Script correctly detects when CVMs are running

### 3. âœ… Fixed Hub WireGuard Installation
- **Problem**: Initial hub deployment failed to install WireGuard due to apt errors
- **Solution**: Manually installed WireGuard and started the service
- **Result**: Hub is now running WireGuard successfully

## Current Infrastructure State

### DigitalOcean Hub âœ…
- **IP**: 206.189.233.124
- **WireGuard**: Running and configured
- **Public Key**: xlnYuaG1XZ0qrAmkPy9pDd8EXcq8RE3/zqL/xL2vPFY=
- **Network**: 10.88.0.1/24
- **Peers Configured**: 1 (node at 10.88.0.11)
- **Status**: Fully operational

### Phala CVM Node ðŸŸ¡
- **Name**: dstack-vpn-node-1
- **Status**: Running
- **Host**: c73dd704e4fb030ff3450f24642139e167379669-8090.dstack-prod7.phala.network
- **WireGuard**: Unknown status
- **Status Page**: Not accessible on port 8000
- **SSH**: Not available (by design)

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Node-to-Hub Connection
- **Issue**: No WireGuard handshake between node and hub
- **Cause**: Unknown - could be:
  - WireGuard not starting in the container
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Configuration mismatch
  - Container image incompatibility

### 2. Status Monitoring
- **Issue**: Cannot access status page on port 8000
- **Cause**: The `linuxserver/wireguard` image doesn't include our status service
- **Solution Attempted**: Built custom image but couldn't push to Docker Hub

### 3. Visibility Problem
- **Issue**: Cannot SSH into Phala CVMs to debug
- **Impact**: Can't verify if WireGuard is running or check logs
- **Workaround**: Need status endpoint or logs accessible via HTTPS

## Script Improvements Made

```bash
# Before: Would hang on prompts
phala cvms create \
    --name ${NODE_NAME} \
    --teepod-id ${NODE_ID} \
    --image dstack-0.3.6 \
    --compose docker-compose.yml

# After: Creates temp file with values, no prompts
cat > ${TEMP_COMPOSE} << EOF
version: '3.8'
services:
  wireguard-node:
    image: linuxserver/wireguard:latest
    environment:
      - NODE_ID=${NODE_NAME}
      - NODE_IP=${NODE_IP}
      - HUB_PUBLIC_IP=${HUB_PUBLIC_IP}
      - HUB_PUBLIC_KEY=${HUB_PUBLIC}
      - WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY=${NODE_PRIVATE_KEY}
    # ... rest of config
EOF

phala cvms create \
    --name ${NODE_NAME} \
    --teepod-id ${NODE_ID} \
    --image dstack-0.3.6 \
    --compose ${TEMP_COMPOSE} \
    --skip-env

rm -f ${TEMP_COMPOSE}
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Phala CVM Limitations
- No SSH access to debug containers
- Need proper monitoring/status endpoints
- Container images must be self-contained
- Environment variable handling is complex

### 2. Deployment Script Design
- Must handle all configuration dynamically
- No reliance on .env files or user input
- Temporary files for per-node configuration
- Proper cleanup of temporary resources

### 3. Docker Image Requirements
- Standard images may not work as expected
- Need custom images with proper monitoring
- Must be pushed to public registry
- Should include health checks and status endpoints

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Push Custom Image**: Push the `dstack-wireguard-node` image to Docker Hub
2. **Redeploy Node**: Use custom image with built-in status service
3. **Verify Connectivity**: Check if WireGuard connects with proper image

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Better Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and status endpoints
2. **Error Recovery**: Handle partial deployments gracefully
3. **Documentation**: Clear requirements for Phala CVM deployments
4. **Testing**: Local Docker Compose testing before Phala deployment

## Conclusion

The deployment script has been successfully fixed to work without user interaction and properly detect CVM status. The DigitalOcean hub is fully operational with WireGuard running. However, the Phala node deployment faces visibility and debugging challenges that require a custom Docker image with proper monitoring capabilities.

The fundamental issues are:
1. **No SSH access** to Phala CVMs for debugging
2. **Standard images** don't include necessary monitoring
3. **Environment variables** may not be properly passed to containers

The path forward is to use a custom Docker image that includes both WireGuard and status monitoring, making the node deployment observable and debuggable through HTTPS endpoints.
