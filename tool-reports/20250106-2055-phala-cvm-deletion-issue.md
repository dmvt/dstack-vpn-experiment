# Phala CVM Deletion Issue - Stuck in "Deleting" Status

**Date:** 2025-01-06 20:55  
**Issue:** CVM stuck in "deleting" status after deletion command  
**Status:** ðŸ”´ Critical - Blocking further deployment

## Problem Description

After attempting to delete a problematic CVM that was stuck in "starting" status, the CVM is now stuck in "deleting" status and cannot be removed from the system.

### CVM Details
- **Name**: dstack-vpn-node-1
- **App ID**: app_b894bc9096a3da5badae207ac1b059e9b7fbbbbe
- **CVM ID**: 61a097cf0202410cac59d8faac5f5c87
- **Status**: deleting (stuck)
- **Phala Node**: prod7-legacy (ID: 6)

## Timeline of Events

1. **20:47** - CVM created on node 6
2. **20:47-20:55** - CVM stuck in "starting" status
3. **20:55** - CVM deleted with `--force` flag
4. **20:55+** - CVM stuck in "deleting" status

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Phala System Synchronization
- **Symptom**: CVM status not updating after deletion command
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Phala node synchronization issues
  - Database state inconsistency
  - Resource cleanup problems on the node
  - Network connectivity issues between CLI and node

### Contributing Factors
1. **Node Health**: prod7-legacy node may have underlying issues
2. **Resource Constraints**: Node may be resource-constrained
3. **System State**: Phala system may be in inconsistent state

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Impact
- **Deployment Blocked**: Cannot create new CVMs while deletion is pending
- **Resource Leak**: CVM resources may still be allocated
- **System Inconsistency**: Phala CLI shows conflicting information

### Long-term Impact
- **Cost Implications**: May continue to incur charges
- **Node Reliability**: Suggests underlying issues with prod7-legacy node
- **Deployment Strategy**: Need alternative approach for VPN deployment

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Force Deletion
```bash
phala cvms delete app_b894bc9096a3da5badae207ac1b059e9b7fbbbbe --force
```
- **Result**: Command succeeds but status doesn't update
- **Status**: Still showing as "deleting"

### 2. Multiple Deletion Attempts
- **Result**: Same behavior each time
- **Status**: No change in CVM status

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions
1. **Wait for System Sync**: Allow 30-60 minutes for system to catch up
2. **Check Node Health**: Verify prod7-legacy node is functioning
3. **Contact Phala Support**: If issue persists beyond 1 hour

### Alternative Deployment Strategies
1. **Use Different Node**: Try deploying on prod8 (ID: 8) instead
2. **Manual Deployment**: Deploy WireGuard directly on working hub
3. **Local Testing**: Test VPN functionality with just the hub

### System Investigation
1. **Node Resource Check**: Verify prod7-legacy has sufficient resources
2. **Network Connectivity**: Check node-to-CLI communication
3. **Phala System Status**: Check overall Phala network health

## Technical Details

### Phala Node Information
- **Node 6 (prod7-legacy)**: FMSPC: 90c06f000000
- **Node 8 (prod8)**: No FMSPC (may be more reliable)
- **Region**: Both in US-WEST-1

### Available Images
- dstack-0.3.6 (what we tried)
- dstack-dev-0.3.6
- dstack-0.3.5
- dstack-dev-0.3.5

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Monitor CVM Status**: Check if deletion completes
2. **Verify Node Health**: Check if prod7-legacy is responsive
3. **Plan Alternative**: Prepare backup deployment strategy

### Medium-term (Next 2 hours)
1. **Try Different Node**: Attempt deployment on prod8
2. **Test Node Reliability**: Verify prod8 is more stable
3. **Complete VPN Setup**: Deploy remaining infrastructure

### Long-term (Next 24 hours)
1. **Document Lessons**: Record what we learned about Phala reliability
2. **Update Deployment Script**: Add better error handling and fallbacks
3. **Consider Alternatives**: Evaluate other deployment platforms if needed

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: CVM deletion stuck, blocking deployment
- **Medium Risk**: prod7-legacy node may have systemic issues
- **Low Risk**: prod8 node may be more reliable

## Success Criteria

- [ ] CVM successfully deleted or removed from system
- [ ] Alternative deployment strategy implemented
- [ ] VPN functionality working with at least one node
- [ ] Lessons learned documented for future deployments

## Conclusion

The Phala CVM deletion issue indicates potential problems with the prod7-legacy node or the Phala system itself. While this blocks our current deployment approach, we have alternatives available and should proceed with a different strategy rather than waiting indefinitely for the stuck deletion to resolve.
