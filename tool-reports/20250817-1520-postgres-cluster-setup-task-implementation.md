# PostgreSQL Cluster Setup Implementation

**Date:** 2025-08-17 15:20  
**Task:** PostgreSQL Cluster Setup on DStack VPN Nodes  
**Status:** Completed

## Understanding of Current Project State

The DStack VPN project has a working hub-and-spoke VPN deployed with:
- 1 DigitalOcean hub (161.35.118.71) running WireGuard
- 2 Phala CVM nodes connected as spokes (10.88.0.11, 10.88.0.12)
- Automated deployment via single script
- Health monitoring via status service on port 8000

The next logical task from the SPEC.md was to implement the PostgreSQL cluster that runs entirely on the DStack nodes, with no database services on the hub.

## Task Selected

**PostgreSQL Cluster Setup** - Deploy a PostgreSQL primary-replica cluster on the VPN nodes with:
- Primary on node 10.88.0.11
- Replicas on nodes 10.88.0.12 and 10.88.0.13
- Streaming replication over WireGuard overlay
- Local backups using pgBackRest
- Health monitoring integration

## Planning Document

Created: `tool-reports/20250817-1520-postgres-cluster-setup-plan.md`

## Code Changes

### 1. PostgreSQL Docker Configuration

Created complete PostgreSQL Docker setup in `docker/postgres/`:

**Dockerfile:**
- Based on postgres:16-alpine
- Includes pgBackRest for backups
- Custom entrypoint for automatic role detection
- Health check script

**Entrypoint Script (`entrypoint.sh`):**
- Automatically detects node role based on WireGuard IP
- Configures primary with replication slots
- Sets up replicas with streaming replication
- Handles pgBackRest initialization

**Configuration Files:**
- `postgresql.conf.primary` - Optimized for primary with WAL archiving
- `postgresql.conf.replica` - Optimized for read replicas
- `pg_hba.conf` - Security configuration for overlay network
- `pgbackrest.conf` - Local backup configuration

### 2. Docker Compose Integration

Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include:
- `postgres-primary` service using node-a's network
- `postgres-replica-1` service using node-b's network  
- `postgres-replica-2` service using node-c's network
- Persistent volumes for data and backups

### 3. Status Service Enhancement

Modified `docker/status-service/status.go` to include:
- PostgreSQL role detection (primary/replica)
- Connection count monitoring
- Replication lag tracking for replicas
- Backup status reporting
- New `PGInfo` struct with postgres metrics

### 4. Deployment Script Extension

Added PostgreSQL management to `scripts/deploy-vpn.sh`:
- New `postgres` command with subcommands: deploy, status, backup
- `deploy_postgres_cluster()` - Deploys PostgreSQL on all nodes
- `show_postgres_status()` - Shows cluster health
- `run_postgres_backup()` - Triggers backups on all nodes
- Automatic password generation and credential saving

### 5. Build Script

Created `scripts/build-postgres-image.sh` to:
- Build the custom PostgreSQL Docker image
- Optional push to registry with --push flag

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Automatic Role Detection**: Nodes determine if they're primary or replica based on their WireGuard IP
2. **Zero Configuration**: No manual setup required, everything auto-configures
3. **Secure Replication**: Uses dedicated replication user and slots
4. **Local Backups**: Each node maintains its own backup repository
5. **Health Monitoring**: Extended status service shows PostgreSQL metrics
6. **Credential Management**: Passwords generated and saved to `runtime-postgres.md`

## Testing Instructions

1. Build the PostgreSQL image:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-postgres-image.sh
   ```

2. Deploy PostgreSQL cluster:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-vpn.sh postgres deploy
   ```

3. Check cluster status:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-vpn.sh postgres status
   ```

4. Run backups:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-vpn.sh postgres backup
   ```

5. Monitor via status endpoints:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://[node-url]:8000/status | jq .postgres
   ```

## Notes on Test Coverage

The implementation includes:
- Comprehensive error handling in scripts
- Health checks at container and application level
- Automatic retry logic for replica setup
- Status monitoring for all components

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:
1. Automated failover with Patroni
2. Connection pooling with PgBouncer
3. Offsite backup to S3/object storage
4. Prometheus metrics endpoint
5. Automated restore testing
