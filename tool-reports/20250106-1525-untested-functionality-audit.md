# Untested Functionality Audit

**Date:** 2025-01-06 15:25  
**Language Detected:** JavaScript  
**Project:** DStack VPN Experiment with NFT Access Control

## 🔧 Low-Coverage Areas (<80%)

| File | Coverage | Missing Functions |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| `src/contract-client.js` | ~60% | Error handling paths, event listeners, complex scenarios |
| `scripts/register-node.js` | ~40% | CLI interface, key generation, IP assignment logic |
| `scripts/test-contract-integration.js` | ~70% | Edge cases, error scenarios, rate limiting |

## 🚪 Critical Entrypoints & Test Gaps

| Entrypoint | Type | Tested? | Notes |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|
| `node scripts/register-node.js register` | CLI | ❌ No | No integration test for actual NFT minting |
| `node scripts/register-node.js verify` | CLI | ⚠️ Partial | Only basic verification, missing edge cases |
| `DstackContractClient.mintNodeAccess()` | API | ❌ No | No test with real private key and contract write |
| `DstackContractClient.revokeNodeAccess()` | API | ❌ No | No test for access revocation |
| `NodeRegistrar.generateWireGuardKeys()` | API | ❌ No | No unit test for key generation |
| `NodeRegistrar.assignIPAddress()` | API | ❌ No | No test for IP conflict resolution |
| WireGuard container integration | Integration | ❌ No | No test with contract-aware containers |

## 🧠 Recommended Test Cases

### High Priority (Security & Core Functionality)
- **NFT minting integration test** - Test actual contract write operations with real private key
- **Access revocation test** - Verify NFT revocation immediately denies VPN access
- **Key generation security test** - Ensure WireGuard keys are cryptographically secure
- **IP address conflict test** - Test automatic IP assignment when conflicts occur
- **Contract event monitoring test** - Verify real-time updates from contract events

### Medium Priority (Error Handling & Edge Cases)
- **Rate limiting test** - Test behavior when Base RPC hits rate limits
- **Network failure test** - Test graceful degradation when contract is unreachable
- **Invalid input test** - Test CLI with malformed addresses, node IDs, public keys
- **Registry corruption test** - Test recovery from corrupted local registry files
- **Concurrent registration test** - Test multiple simultaneous node registrations

### Low Priority (User Experience & Documentation)
- **CLI help test** - Verify all command help text is accurate
- **Configuration validation test** - Test invalid contract config handling
- **Logging test** - Verify proper error and success logging
- **Performance test** - Test contract interaction latency under load

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

- Contract owner verification

### Node Registration (`scripts/register-node.js`)
**Current Coverage:** ~40%
**Missing Tests:**
- `generateWireGuardKeys()` cryptographic security
- `assignIPAddress()` conflict resolution
- `registerNode()` end-to-end flow with contract
- CLI argument parsing and validation
- Registry file corruption handling
- Concurrent access to registry

### Test Infrastructure (`scripts/test-contract-integration.js`)
**Current Coverage:** ~70%
**Missing Tests:**
- Mock contract responses for offline testing
- Error injection for failure scenarios
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory leak detection
- Test data cleanup

## 🎯 Test Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Security Tests
1. **NFT minting with real contract** - Critical for production use
2. **Access revocation verification** - Essential security feature
3. **Key generation security** - Cryptographic validation required

### Phase 2: Error Handling Tests
1. **Rate limiting scenarios** - Common production issue
2. **Network failure handling** - Graceful degradation needed
3. **Invalid input validation** - CLI robustness

### Phase 3: Integration Tests
1. **WireGuard container integration** - End-to-end functionality
2. **Contract event monitoring** - Real-time updates
3. **Performance under load** - Production readiness
