# VPN Deployment Success Report

**Date:** 2025-08-17 14:35  
**Status:** ✅ Fully Operational  
**Deployment Method:** Custom multi-architecture Docker image on Phala CVM

## Summary

Successfully deployed a WireGuard VPN network with:
- **1 DigitalOcean Hub**: 167.172.147.84 (10.88.0.1)
- **1 Phala CVM Node**: dstack-vpn-node-1 (10.88.0.11)
- **Full connectivity**: Bidirectional communication verified

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Multi-Architecture Docker Image
- **Problem**: Initial image was ARM64-only (built on Mac)
- **Solution**: Built and pushed multi-arch image (AMD64 + ARM64)
- **Image**: `lsdan/dstack-wireguard-node:latest`

### 2. Custom Docker Image with Status Service
- **Problem**: Standard WireGuard images lack monitoring capabilities
- **Solution**: Created custom image with integrated Go status service
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `/status` - Full node status with WireGuard info
  - `/health` - Simple health check

### 3. Deployment Script Updates
- **Problem**: Script tried to SSH into Phala CVMs
- **Solution**: Updated to use self-contained Docker image
- **Result**: Clean deployment without SSH requirements

## Current Infrastructure

### Hub (DigitalOcean)
```
IP: 167.172.147.84
WireGuard: 10.88.0.1/24
Status: ✅ Online
Latest handshake: Active
```

### Node 1 (Phala CVM)
```
App ID: app_9d44ba8a55276170fe5417cc236a8ce1c9587dec
Container: 8b5c9e7c91df
WireGuard: 10.88.0.11/32
Status URL: https://9d44ba8a55276170fe5417cc236a8ce1c9587dec-8000.dstack-prod7.phala.network/
Status: ✅ Healthy
```

## Connectivity Test Results

### WireGuard Handshake
```
peer: JVeMkAt/Cje7FiPVQ79OePIQBiZjwp8ApJ38LjkNwBI=
endpoint: 66.220.6.107:54056
latest handshake: 60 seconds ago
transfer: 244 B received, 124 B sent
```

### Ping Test (Hub → Node)
```
PING 10.88.0.11: 3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss
RTT min/avg/max = 70.737/71.011/71.207 ms
```

### Node Status Response
```json
{
  "node": "8b5c9e7c91df",
  "overlay_ip": "10.88.0.11",
  "wg": {
    "interface": "wg0",
    "peer_count": 1,
    "max_last_handshake_sec": 60
  },
  "disk_free_gb": 36.6,
  "time": "2025-08-17T18:34:19Z"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Scale Testing**: Deploy additional nodes (2-5) to test multi-node connectivity
2. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark throughput and latency
3. **Monitoring**: Set up continuous monitoring of all nodes
4. **Documentation**: Update README with successful deployment process

## Lessons Learned

1. **Phala URL Format**: Status endpoints use `{APP_ID}-{PORT}.dstack-prod7.phala.network`
2. **Multi-Arch Required**: Phala CVMs run on AMD64, requiring multi-architecture images
3. **Self-Contained Images**: Best approach for Phala is fully self-contained Docker images
4. **WireGuard Works**: Despite no SSH access, WireGuard successfully establishes connections

## Commands for Management

### Check Status
```bash
./scripts/deploy-vpn.sh status
```

### Monitor Node
```bash
curl -s https://9d44ba8a55276170fe5417cc236a8ce1c9587dec-8000.dstack-prod7.phala.network/status | jq .
```

### Test Connectivity
```bash
ssh root@167.172.147.84 "ping -c 3 10.88.0.11"
```

### Destroy Infrastructure
```bash
./scripts/deploy-vpn.sh destroy --force
```

## Conclusion

The DStack VPN deployment is now fully operational with secure WireGuard connectivity between the DigitalOcean hub and Phala CVM nodes. The custom Docker image with integrated monitoring provides visibility into node status without requiring SSH access.
