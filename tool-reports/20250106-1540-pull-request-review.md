   - **Impact:** High - critical functionality unvalidated
   - **Fix:** Add testnet integration or mock testing for write operations
   - **Location:** `scripts/test-contract-integration.js` - add write operation tests

3. **README Documentation Updates**
   - **Issue:** Missing documentation for new NFT features
   - **Impact:** Medium - affects user adoption
   - **Fix:** Add comprehensive documentation for contract integration
   - **Location:** `README.md` - add new sections for NFT features

4. **Error Recovery Enhancement**
   - **Issue:** Basic error handling for network failures
   - **Impact:** Medium - affects production stability
   - **Fix:** Implement comprehensive error recovery and fallback mechanisms
   - **Location:** `src/contract-client.js` - enhance error handling

### 🟠 Optional After Merge

   - **Impact:** Medium - affects code quality and maintenance
   - **Fix:** Implement Jest framework for unit tests
   - **Location:** Add `__tests__/` directory with comprehensive test suite

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Issue:** No caching or connection pooling for contract calls
   - **Impact:** Low - affects scalability
   - **Fix:** Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data
   - **Location:** `src/contract-client.js` - add caching mechanism

7. **CLI Enhancement**
   - **Issue:** Basic CLI with limited error handling
   - **Impact:** Low - affects user experience
   - **Fix:** Add input validation and better error messages
   - **Location:** `scripts/register-node.js` - enhance CLI robustness

8. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Issue:** Basic logging without structured format
   - **Impact:** Low - affects operational visibility
   - **Fix:** Implement structured logging with different levels
   - **Location:** All files - add comprehensive logging
